# Introduction

The simulation source code in our paper **MERCURY: Fast Transaction Broadcast in High
Performance Blockchain Systems(Accepted by [INFOCOM 2023](https://infocom2023.ieee-infocom.org/program/accepted-paper-list-main-conference))** is available here.

**MERCURY** shortens the transaction propagation delay using two techniques: a virtual
coordinate system and an early outburst strategy. 
Our simulation results show that **MERCURY** outperforms prior propagation schemes and decreases overall propagation latency by up to 44% compared with Random mechanism.
When implemented in [Conflux](https://confluxnetwork.org/), an open-source high-throughput blockchain system, **MERCURY** reduces transaction propagation latency by over 50% with less than 5% bandwidth overhead.
Please review our paper for more details.
