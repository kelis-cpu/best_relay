Test the vivaldi code: 

1. Impact of random measurement error

After finishing the extra secure layer:
2. Impact of  attackers to the coordinate system

3. Testing the broadcast algorithm based on the vivaldi system

After finishing the extra secure layer:
4. Testing the broadcast algorithm based on the ``secure'' vivaldi system under presence of attackers
(e.g. from 0% - 49%)
